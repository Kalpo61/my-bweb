    <p>I thing the best thing to watch in the whole world is BL dramas. High quality BLs are the best among everything. BL dramas are too enjoyable.

    <h3>All about asian dramas</h3>
    <p>The only country that produced many BL dramas without any restriction is Thailand. Some other countries recently started to produced BL dramas too. I really wish for China to start producing them because China produces the best bromance dramas which are really really famous. If they starts then they would left behind all countries. :) </p>

           <h3>guardian | Bromance</h3>
           <p>Guardian is a 2018 chinese web series starring Bai Yu and Zhu Yilong. An adaptation of the 2012 fantasy-denmei web novel of the same name by Priest, the series was released on the video platform Touku between june 13 and july 25, 2018. The series follows Zhao Yunlan(Bai) and Shen Wei(Zhu), a detective and a professor who investigate supernatural phenomena. Though the novel depicts their relationship as romantic in nature, the web series depicts the relationship as a platonic friendship with homoerotic subtext in response to chinese prohibiting depictions of same-sex relationships on television.</p>
           <p>The series ws widly popular on web and received a total of 1.8 billion views by August 2018. That same month, Guardian was pulled from Youku amid a crackdown on "harmful and vulgar" internet content but was later re-uploaded</p>
